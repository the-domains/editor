Experienced professional editors available now ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dc82d8f3-5017-4242-b6e3-3714bf681d78.jpg)

How do I get started? 

1\. Start a project with a simple description 

Use our project start form to tell us who you are and what your video is about. How long should your video be? (for example- 3 minutes) How much raw video footage do you have? (for example- 20 minutes). Which languages spoken in your video? With this brief description we can contact a shortlist of qualified editors with relevant experience and skills. You can always add more information about your project once you have chosen your editor.

2\. Upload your video files for our editors to view 

Our editors work to competitive market rates, but in most cases an editor will want to see your video material before committing to the work. You can simply upload video files from your device to our site using this webform. If your footage is already stored in the cloud you can simply send us a link to the footage and we will import the videos. The Editors have an integration with Dropbox, Google Drive & Photos, OneDrive. Our editors will view your material and using their experience make a fixed price offer for the job.

3\. Select your editor

Soon after starting a project you'll be getting proposals from our editors. For Example: "I'll be happy to edit this video for $150, it should take about 3 days."You can review the editors' portfolios and see their previous work. Send the many questions you might have, and request examples of similar videos they've edited in the past. Treat this process like you would any interview. When you're confident about the editor you want to hire, accept his or her proposal.You'll be prompted to enter your PayPal/creditcard details, but will not be billed. Your account will only be charged when the work is done.
